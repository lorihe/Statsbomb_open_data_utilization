## World Cup 2023 Data Visualization -- using Statsbomb data
Great appreciation towards [Statsbomb](https://statsbomb.com/) for sharing valuable [data](https://statsbomb.com/news/statsbomb-release-free-2023-womens-world-cup-data/) of the Women's World Cup 2023, as part of their commitment to support women's soccer. 

This project built a dashboard app using Statsbomb data to visualize team tactics of all games in the World Cup 2023. 

Open the app at: https://world-cup-2023-tactic-visualization.onrender.com/

The app was built with [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/), a Python framework for building interactive web applications. It's deployed on [render](https://dashboard.render.com/).
